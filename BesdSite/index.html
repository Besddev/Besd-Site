        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Besd, a passionate self-taught developer with a love for coding. My journey began with Minecraft's <strong>Skript</strong> language, where I discovered that I can do what I want and it was AMAZING. After that, I decided to dive deeper into programming and learned <strong>Python</strong>, which opened the door to more advanced projects.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>As I grew more skilled, I picked up <strong>Java</strong> and expanded my toolkit. However, I soon realized that Minecraft coding wasn't my thing because I couldn't show off my self. So That is reason for different languages. Now, I actively work with <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, building various applications and improving my skills daily. Recently, I've started learning <strong>C++</strong>, and I'm making great progress as I tackle more complex programming challenges.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>So now I can code <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> and perhaps in future learning <strong>Web Development</strong>.</p>
